# QuestionGenerator-GPT2
This code can be used to perform fine-tuning of a Transformers GPT2 model on a dataset composed of questions by F. Nietzsche. 
The goal is to create a model that can generate questions with philosophical flavor, in the style of the famous philospher.

## Dataset and fine-tuning
In order to perform the training (fine-tuning) of the model, it is necessary to include the file 'sentences.csv' in the current directory.
